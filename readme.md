# Testing practice using Jest

## Description

This project contains the solutions to [this assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice#assignment) from The Odin Project, which is a beginners guide to testing using Jest. Testing is not really that difficult, but the only way to get comfortable with it is to spend some time doing it.

The project uses Jest to run tests from the `/tests` on the code from the `/src`. There are a total of 5 exercises:

1. [`capitalize.js`](src/capitalize.js) with tests at [`capitalize.test.js`](tests/capitalize.test.js).
2. [`reverseString.js`](src/reverseString.js) with tests at [`reverseString.test.js`](tests/reverseString.test.js).
3. [`calculator.js`](src/calculator.js) with tests at [`calculator.test.js`](tests/calculator.test.js).
4. [`caesarCipher.js`](src/caesarCipher.js) with tests at [`caesarCipher.test.js`](tests/caesarCipher.test.js).
5. [`analyzeArray.js`](src/analyzeArray.js) with tests at [`analyzeArray.test.js`](tests/analyzeArray.test.js).

## Technologies Used

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=jest,babel,js)](https://skillicons.dev)

Babel was used for allowing the use of ES6 `import` syntax in Jest.
